This is a very simple web application to test a Cuckoo Resource Adapter for SAP configuration in an application server.

The application can be built with "mvn install" from the command line. 

After deploying it, a page can be displayed which calls the function module RFC_SYSTEM_INFO in the SAP backend and displays a few values returned by SAP. If something is wrong, like the SAP system cannot be reached or the resource adapter configuration is wrong, a Java stacktrace is shown which can be used for further debugging.

The JNDI name to look up the connection factory is defined as a constant named CONNECTION_FACTORY_JNDI_NAME in class org.cuckoo.ra.test.CuckooBean and might need to be changed according to the application server which is used. The default is "eis/sap/NSP", which works with Glassfish.

For more information regarding the Cuckoo Resource Adapter see the project page: https://sourceforge.net/p/cuckoo-ra

See the page "Application server specific configuration" in the project page's wiki for configuration examples.
